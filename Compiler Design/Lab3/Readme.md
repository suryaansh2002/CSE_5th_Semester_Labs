## Lab 3

1. Design a lexical analyzer which contains getNextToken( ) for a simple C program to create a structure of token each time and return, which includes row number, column number and token type. The tokens to be identified are arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators, special symbols, keywords, numerical constants, string literals and identifiers. Also, getNextToken() should ignore all the tokens when encountered inside single line or multiline comment or inside string literal. Preprocessor directive should also be stripped.
