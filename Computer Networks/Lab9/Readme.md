## Lab 9

1. Set up a simple wired network with two nodes n0 and n1 for UDP_CBR traffic. Provide duplex link between these nodes having propagation delay of 10msec and capacity of 10Mb by considering n0 as source node and n1 as sink node.


2. Set up a simple wired network with two nodes n0 and n1 for TCP_FTP traffic. Provide duplex link between these nodes having propagation delay of 10msec and capacity of 10Mb by considering n0 as source node and n1 as sink node.


3. Set up the LAN network with 4 nodes, duplex-link node N1 to node N2 is 2Mb capacity and 20ms delay, duplex-link node N3 to node N4 is 1Mb capacity and 10ms delay. N1(source) and N2(sink), N3(source) and N4(sink). Change the color of the flow between the nodes. Duration of the simulation is 5 seconds.
