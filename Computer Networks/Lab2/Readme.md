## Lab 2


1. Rewrite the sample program using suitable modular programming techniques


3. Write a TCP concurrent client server program where server accepts integer array from
client and sorts it and returns it to the client along with process id.


4. Implement concurrent Remote Math Server To perform arithmetic operations in the
server and display the result at the client. The client accepts two integers and an
operator from the user and sends it to the server. The server then receives integers and
operator. The server will performs the operation on integers and sends result back to
the client which is displayed on the client screen. Then both the processes terminate.


5. Implement simple TCP daytime server using select().
